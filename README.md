Rob's Dungeon Generator

TODO: Switch out Set Piece for an Option so they only show up when an 11 or 12 is rolled.

## Rationale

I want a config-driven CLI tool to procedurally generate rooms for arbitrary homebrew roleplay.

Building Rooms, Monsters, NPCs, and Items are currently in scope.

Progress:

- [x] Rooms
- [x] Monsters
- [x] Robots
- [x] NPCs
- [x] Environmental Hazards
- [ ] Items

## Why Rust?

Because I haven't done something in Rust before and this is about finding the right blend of cozy and challenge right now.

I'm enjoying the Rust.


## Why GPL?

Because I don't see this ever being seriously forked by anyone else anyway, and I've been using @gnubeard as a slack handle so long that it's kind of embarrassing I haven't GPLd more of my own code
