Rob's Dungeon Generator

TODO: Add docs.


## Rationale

I want a CLI tool to procedurally generate rooms for arbitrary homebrew roleplay.

Building Rooms, Monsters, NPCs, and Items are currently in scope.

Progress:

[x] Rooms
[x] Monsters
[ ] Robots
[ ] NPCs

## Why Rust?

Because I haven't done something in Rust before and this is about finding the right blend of cozy and challenge right now.

I'm enjoying the Rust.


## Why GPL?

Because I don't see this ever being seriously forked by anyone else anyway, and I've been using @gnubeard as a slack handle so long that it's kind of embarrassing I haven't GPLd more of my own code

## Building

cargo test, cargo run, cargo build. Rust is great

## Contributing

Oh, thanks! This is really just a silly personal project but feel free to do whatever.
I might accept your pull request but also maybe not? This is just a fun project for me.
